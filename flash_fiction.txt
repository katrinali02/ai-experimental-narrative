It was a bright, sunny day. The small, boring dragonfly decided to take a fly 
along the ocean. The small, boring dragonfly soon saw the small shark that he has beef with.
The small shark, seeing the dragonfly, glared back. Soon, they started a fight.
Nearby, the big eagle stood watch. As the adoptee child between the small, boring dragonfly and 
the small shark, he sighed as he watched his parents fight over his custody once more. 

As the fight ensued, a big, annoying dragonfly came by to watch and do nothing else. However, the dragonfly
saw the head of the medium, fast dolphin swimming near the small shark. Triggered, the big dragonfly flew down 
to provoke the dolphin. How dare she steal his fish? The dolphin is now angry because she did not seal the dragonfly's fish.
Looks like there will be two fights today.

Standing under the tree in the shade, a big, good lizard watches the two fights worsen. Seeing how it is such a nice
day, she didn't want to see the animals continuing to fight with each other. She tells her right-hand man, a
small, smart eagle to go and break up the fights. However, the smart eagle likes the drama and instead, flies forth
and stirs the pot even more, deceiving the big, good lizard. But... little does the eagle know that the lizard had a backup plan:
if the fight continues, she knows the dragonflies will leave and come near the tree - just in time
for her afternoon snack.
